My brother tried my game and he said it was pretty cool.
I asked him what he liked the most about the game and
he said he liked the art style because it was simple and
easy on the eyes. I asked what could be added to the game
and he said a setting for difficulty to have different
amount of grids. I asked him if he hated anything about the 
game and he said nothing. Overall, he enjoyed my project.
